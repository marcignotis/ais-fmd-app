Backend abstraction.

Two implementations share this interface:

  * `SqliteBackend`  -- the sandbox. A local file, seeded with fake data.
  * `SupabaseBackend` -- production. Refuses to load in sandbox mode, and its
    dependency is not installed in the sandbox venv.

Every method that mutates data takes an `actor`, because the audit trail (M2)
is not optional. There is no write path that skips it.
