# Contributing — Fall 2026 treasury team

How we build the AIS Financial Management app together this semester. Read this
once end to end before your first commit. It is short on purpose.

**The model in one line:** you fork the repo, work on a branch in your fork,
prove your change in the sandbox, and open a pull request. Your partner reviews
it, and the treasurer merges it. Nobody else has push access to the main repo,
so every change arrives this way.

---

## 1. Get set up (do this before your first team session)

You need: Git, Python **3.11, 3.12 or 3.13** (CI tests all three), and a
GitHub account. The repo is public, so you do not need to be added to anything.

`main` still holds the old app. **All work this semester branches from and
targets `sandbox/mvp-rebuild`.**

### Just want to run it?

```bash
git clone -b sandbox/mvp-rebuild https://github.com/treasuryufais/ais-fmd-app.git
cd ais-fmd-app
```

No Git? Download the ZIP instead:
<https://github.com/treasuryufais/ais-fmd-app/archive/refs/heads/sandbox/mvp-rebuild.zip>

### Going to contribute? Fork first

1. On <https://github.com/treasuryufais/ais-fmd-app>, click **Fork**.
   **Untick "Copy the `main` branch only"** — otherwise your fork will not
   have `sandbox/mvp-rebuild`.
2. Clone your fork and connect it to the team repo:

```bash
git clone -b sandbox/mvp-rebuild https://github.com/<your-username>/ais-fmd-app.git
cd ais-fmd-app
git remote add upstream https://github.com/treasuryufais/ais-fmd-app.git
```

`origin` is your fork (you push here). `upstream` is the team repo (you pull
from here, and your pull requests go to it).

### Create a virtual environment and install

Windows (PowerShell or Git Bash):

```bash
py -3.13 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

macOS / Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install **only** `requirements.txt`. Never `pip install supabase` or `openai`
into this environment — their absence is one of the three things that make the
sandbox physically unable to touch the real database or spend API money.

### Prove your setup works

```bash
# Windows: .venv\Scripts\python   macOS: .venv/bin/python
.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest
.venv\Scripts\python -m streamlit run app.py
```

Tests should finish green (a few are skipped on purpose). The app opens at
<http://localhost:8501> with a **SANDBOX** banner across the top and seeds
itself with several semesters of fake data. If you see that banner, you are set up.

---

## 2. The sandbox is where you prove things

Everything you build runs against a local SQLite file full of generated data.
It has no network access to our database, and it cannot reach an AI service.
That is what makes it safe for everyone to experiment freely.

- **Switch roles** from the sidebar to see a page as a Member, Officer (VP),
  Treasurer or Admin. Test your feature as every role that can reach it.
- **Reset & reseed data** in the sidebar puts the database back to a known state.
  Run it before recording a demo, so what you show is reproducible.
- The seed data has planted problems (an unbalanced statement, uncategorized
  rows, duplicate-looking purchases) so diagnostic pages have something to find.

---

## 3. Data rules — non-negotiable

This repository is **public**. Treat everything you push as published forever.

1. **No real financial data, anywhere in Git.** No bank statements, Venmo
   exports, membership rosters, member names, emails, UFIDs or card numbers —
   not in code, tests, fixtures, screenshots, PR descriptions or issues. (The
   one exception is `ais_fmd/config/card_roster.json`, which maps the last four
   digits of org cards to committees. The treasurer maintains it; nobody else
   adds to it.)
2. **No real data on your machine for this project.** You do not need it.
   If your feature needs to be checked against real statements, write it so it
   runs on the sandbox, and ask the treasurer to run it on the real data.
3. **No keys or secrets.** If you ever see a Supabase URL, key or password,
   tell the treasurer and do not copy it anywhere. `tests/test_no_secrets.py`
   fails the build if one reaches the working tree.
4. **Do not paste real data into AI tools.** Sandbox data is fine.

## 4. Rules about money

Some code decides *which committee a dollar is booked to*. Changing that moves
real money between budgets, so those decisions belong to the treasurer, not to
a pull request.

- `tests/test_treasury_decisions.py` holds one test per treasury ruling. **Never
  edit or delete one of those tests to make your change pass.** If your change
  breaks one, stop and ask.
- `ais_fmd/config/categories.py` and `ais_fmd/config/card_roster.json` are
  treasurer-owned. Propose changes in your PR description; do not make them.
- Never add `"membership"` to `MEMO_COMMITTEE_KEYWORDS`. It appears in dues memos
  and would misfile dues income as a Membership expense.

---

## 5. Day-to-day workflow

### Start a piece of work

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b <team>/<short-description> upstream/sandbox/mvp-rebuild   # e.g. vp/committee-home
```

Team prefixes: `vp/`, `cat/`, `model/`, `platform/`, `qa/`, `close/`, `ux/`.

**One branch per person per slice of work.** Pairs split a feature into pieces
and each person opens their own pull requests. Small PRs get reviewed in a day;
2,000-line PRs sit for a week. Aim for under ~400 changed lines.

### Stay current

At least twice a week, bring in what has been merged since you branched:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/sandbox/mvp-rebuild
```

Fix any conflicts, re-run the tests, commit.

### Before you open a pull request

- [ ] `pytest` is green locally.
- [ ] New logic has new tests. Business logic lives in `ais_fmd/domain/` and is
      tested without Streamlit; pages are tested headlessly — copy the patterns
      in `tests/test_views.py`.
- [ ] You **restarted Streamlit** and checked the page by hand, as each role that
      can reach it (see the traps below — the app does not reload package code).
- [ ] You captured a screenshot or short recording from the sandbox.

### Open the pull request

```bash
git push -u origin <team>/<short-description>    # goes to YOUR fork
```

- On GitHub, click **Compare & pull request**. Set the base to
  **`treasuryufais/ais-fmd-app` → `sandbox/mvp-rebuild`** (not `main`).
- Fill in the template — it asks how you proved the change in the sandbox.
- Ask **your partner** to review it first. Once they approve and the tests are
  green, the treasurer reviews and merges.
- On your very first PR, the automatic tests wait until the treasurer clicks
  **Approve and run**. That is GitHub's default for forks, not a problem with
  your PR.

### Shared files — coordinate before editing

These are touched by several teams. Keep edits small and mention them in your PR:

| File | Why it collides |
| --- | --- |
| `app.py` (`PAGES` list) | Every new page is registered here |
| `ais_fmd/ui/shell.py` | Shared page components — add, don't rewrite |
| `ais_fmd/data/backend.py`, `sqlite_backend.py`, `supabase_backend.py` | Any new data method must be added to all three |
| `ais_fmd/data/repositories.py` | The single caching layer |

---

## 6. Traps that have bitten this project before

Full list in `HANDOFF.md` §9. The ones you will hit in week one:

1. **Streamlit does not hot-reload package code.** Editing anything under
   `ais_fmd/` needs a server restart (Ctrl+C, run again). Editing only a page
   file does not. This will make you think your fix did not work.
2. **`$` renders as math.** Two dollar signs in one `st.markdown` string turn
   the text between them into an equation. Use `shell.say(...)` or
   `shell.notify(...)` for any text containing money.
3. **Views must use absolute imports** — `from ais_fmd import auth`, never
   `from . import ...`.
4. **A pandas NaN is truthy.** `value or ""` does not replace it. Use `pd.isna()`.
5. **`domain/` never imports Streamlit.** A test enforces it. Keep calculations
   there and layout in `views/`.

## 7. Using AI coding tools

Allowed and encouraged — much of this codebase was built that way. Two rules:
you must be able to explain every line in your PR when asked, and you never
give an AI tool real data. Point your tool at `HANDOFF.md` §9 and §11 before it
edits anything; it will save you both an afternoon.

---

## 8. Where to learn the codebase

In this order: `README.md` (safety model) → `HANDOFF.md` §3 (architecture) and
§9 (traps) → `ais_fmd/config/categories.py` (the committee vocabulary) → the
module your team owns → its tests. Your team brief in
`docs/fall-2026-projects.md` lists the exact files.

Stuck for more than 30 minutes? Ask in the team chat with what you tried. That
is expected, not a failure.
