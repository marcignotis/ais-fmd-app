"""
Runtime environment detection and the sandbox safety guard.

The single most important property of this module: **it fails closed.**

`AIS_FMD_ENV` must be set to exactly "production" to leave sandbox mode.
Anything else -- unset, empty, misspelled, garbage -- resolves to SANDBOX.
There is no way to end up talking to a real database by accident.

In sandbox mode:
  * `data.client` refuses to construct a Supabase client at all.
  * `domain.categorize.llm` refuses to make a network call and uses the
    deterministic offline stub instead.
  * Every write goes to a local SQLite file that is created on demand and
    can be deleted without consequence.

# --- Where configuration comes from ------------------------------------------
#
# LAUNCH BUG, fixed here. Every setting below used to read `os.environ` only.
# That is correct on a host where you can set real environment variables, and
# silently wrong on Streamlit Community Cloud, where you cannot -- there the
# only channel is `.streamlit/secrets.toml`.
#
# Streamlit *does* copy top-level secrets into `os.environ`, which is why this
# looked like it worked. But it does that lazily, on the first access to
# `st.secrets`, and `app.py` asked `is_sandbox()` before anything had touched
# `st.secrets`. So `AIS_FMD_ENV` read empty, the fail-closed default returned
# SANDBOX, and a production deployment would quietly serve generated demo data
# with the login gate skipped entirely. No error, no warning.
#
# Reading both sources explicitly removes the ordering dependency and works
# unchanged on either kind of host. A real environment variable wins, because
# setting one is the more deliberate act; secrets are the fallback.
#
# `st.secrets` is imported inside the function, not at module scope, so this
# module stays importable by the scripts in `scripts/` that run outside a
# Streamlit process -- and so a missing or malformed secrets file is a fallback,
# never a crash.

    `[supabase]` block in secrets.toml could never satisfy code reading
    `os.environ["SUPABASE_URL"]`, which is exactly what the project's own
