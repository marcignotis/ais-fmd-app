"""
Add fake demo transactions for the VP committees to the SANDBOX database.

The normal seed books almost nothing to Membership or Passport and spreads most
committees' spending over a single purpose, so a VP's page comes up nearly empty.
This tops each VP committee up to a chosen share of its budget in every term the
sandbox has (five, back to Fall 2024), with several purposes, a few refunds or
deposits coming in, and a mix of states (on track, approaching, over), so every
chart, table and past-term comparison on My Committee and My Transactions has
something to draw. It also adds a fake sign-in profile for each VP and the
treasurer, and a few sample flags for the Review Queue.

Everything here is invented: made-up venues and vendors, no real names, card
numbers or amounts from any statement. It refuses to run outside the sandbox.

    .venv\\Scripts\\python scripts/seed_vp_demo.py

Safe to run twice (the second run says it was already loaded). "Reset & reseed
data" in the sidebar wipes it along with everything else; run this again after.
Restart Streamlit afterwards, or wait a few minutes for its cache to expire.
