Module M18 -- weighted evidence scoring.

WHY THIS REPLACES THE HEURISTIC RULE CHAIN.

`predicates.RULES` is first-match-wins, so the *order* of the rules encodes
every tie-break. That broke in practice: the Membership card rule and the
meeting-food rule both fired on the same rows, and picking a winner meant
hand-ordering them from one fact a treasurer happened to mention (cards got
handed out messily, so meeting food has been bought on the wrong card). A rule
chain cannot express "card says Membership, weekday and merchant say Meeting
Food, so I am genuinely unsure" -- it just silently returns whichever rule was
listed first, at full confidence.

Scoring can. Every signal votes for a committee with a weight; the winner is
the highest total, and **confidence falls when signals conflict**. Two strong
opposing signals produce a low-confidence result that routes to the review
queue instead of being quietly booked. That is the behaviour that was actually
wanted: resolve the clear majority automatically, flag the genuine outliers.

CHANGED 2026-09-23. The card-versus-meeting-food conflict above is no longer
a conflict: treasury ruled that a confirmed card decides its row, so it is
settled by `CardRegistry.certain` before scoring runs. Scoring now weighs the
purchases whose card is not on the roster.

CONFIDENCE IS NOT A RULE CONSTANT. In `predicates.py` each rule carries a fixed
number (0.9, 0.85) that never changes regardless of what else is true about the
row. Here confidence is computed per transaction from two things:

  * evidence strength -- how much total weight landed on the winner
  * dominance         -- how decisively it beat the runner-up

so the same rule firing on a clean row and on a contested row yields different
confidence, which is the entire point.

A NOTE ON LEARNING FROM HISTORY. The obvious next step is to learn these
weights from previously-categorized transactions. That is deliberately NOT done
here, because in this database `budget_category` was written by
`categorize_frame` at import time (see `scripts/load_real_statement.py`), not by
a human. Learning from it would train the model on its own output and harden
existing mistakes into "evidence". `CardRegistry` therefore holds only
treasury-confirmed assignments, and any history-derived affinity must be marked
`verified=False` so it can never outweigh a confirmed one. Real ground truth
has to come from a human working the review queue, or from the historical
ledgers in Drive -- not from this table.
