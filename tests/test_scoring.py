"""
Weighted evidence scoring (M18), the confidence gate, and the card's place above both.

Treasury's ruling of 2026-09-23 decides the shape of these tests: **the card is
the most highly valued evidence there is.** A purchase on a card confirmed for
the current officer cohort is that card's committee, whatever the merchant, the
weekday or the amount suggest -- so the pipeline books it before scoring runs,
and a directly-scored confirmed card still outweighs everything else scoring
can say. Merchant memory is gone from categorization entirely.

What scoring still does is weigh the evidence on purchases whose card is *not*
on the roster, and route the uncertain ones to a human instead of booking them.
