"""
The two sides of "This isn't ours".

`vp_panel` is what a VP sees under their transactions: a way to flag a charge they
think belongs to another committee, and the list of what they have flagged and
how the treasurer answered. `treasurer_panel` is what lands in the Review Queue.

A flag by itself changes nothing: it is a note. Only the treasurer decides where
money is booked. Their verdict on a flag is one of three things -- it is theirs and
stays put, it is not theirs and moves to the committee they pick (the booking and the
flag close together, through the normal edit path so closed terms and the audit trail
still apply), or it was already fixed elsewhere and the flag just closes.

Both are written to be added to an existing page with one call, because the pages
they sit on are shared with other teams.
