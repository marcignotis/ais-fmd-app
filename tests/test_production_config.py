"""
The configuration path that decides whether this is the real app or the demo.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The entire test suite runs in sandbox mode, deliberately.
That is the right default -- but it meant the one path that has to work on a
real deployment was the one path nothing exercised, and a launch-blocking bug
sat there undetected behind 583 green tests:

`settings.get_env()` read `os.environ` only. Streamlit copies top-level
secrets.toml values into `os.environ`, but *lazily*, on first access to
`st.secrets` -- and `app.py` called `is_sandbox()` before anything had touched
it. On Streamlit Community Cloud, where secrets.toml is the only channel there
is, `AIS_FMD_ENV` therefore read empty and the fail-closed default returned
SANDBOX. The deployed app would have seeded generated demo data, skipped the
login gate entirely (sandbox mode returns from `login_gate` immediately), and
served that to anyone with the URL. Silently.

The fail-closed property is still the most important thing in the module and is
covered by `test_sandbox_safety.py`. These tests cover the other half: that
production is actually *reachable* from each kind of host.
