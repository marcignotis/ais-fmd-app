"""
Deterministic categorization rules.

Two changes of substance from the original:

1. **The keyword lists are actually used.** `FOOD_MERCHANT_KEYWORDS` and
   `BAR_LIQUOR_KEYWORDS` were defined in the original module and referenced
   nowhere -- Meeting Food was delegated to the language model even though the
   data needed to decide it locally was sitting right there. Implementing that
   rule in Python is what lets the pipeline stop sending most rows to a model.

2. **Rule order is explicit and matches the documented priority.** The original
   Python override chain ran refund -> consulting -> formal -> dues ->
   membership, while the prompt next to it documented refund -> formal ->
   consulting -> dues -> meeting food -> membership. The ordering lives in one
   list rather than an if/elif chain.

   That order has since been revised twice by treasury rulings (2026-08-24).
   The exact tier now runs memo -> dues -> reimbursement:
   `rule_refund` is gone, because an outgoing transfer is a committee's
   expenditure rather than a ledger bucket, and the memo rule sits ahead of
   dues because the Fall 2026 rates collide with formal ticket amounts. Both
   are explained where the rules are defined.

   Card numbers are no longer rules here at all (2026-09-23). A card on the
   roster decides its row outright, ahead of everything in this module, but
   the roster is data -- `config/card_roster.json`, scoped by officer cohort --
   so it lives in `scoring.CardRegistry` rather than in hard-coded strings like
   the old "card 8408" and "card 8313/5718" markers.

Every function in this module is pure: same input, same output, no I/O. That is
what makes them the highest-value tests in the repository.

# --- Memo vocabulary ---------------------------------------------------------
#
# Treasury, asked whether a payment memo is enough to book a transfer on:
# "Absolutely look at the memos they will clarify it well."
#
# A memo is safe to key on where a payer's *name* is not. `merchants.merchant_key`
# deliberately refuses to learn from an incoming transfer, because a rule keyed
# on one member would mis-categorise everything that member ever pays. A memo is
# the opposite: it is the payer's own statement of what this one payment was
# for, and it travels with that payment only.
#
# ORDER AGAINST `rule_dues` IS LOAD-BEARING. From Fall 2026 the dues rates are
# $50 and $65, and treasury warned that formal payments land near them --
# "there are also going to be some formal dues that might be around those
# amounts but the actual dues are a very specific amount". An amount collision
# between dues and formal is therefore expected rather than hypothetical, and
# the memo is the only evidence that can break the tie. So the memo rule runs
# BEFORE the amount rule: what the payer says it was for outranks what the
# amount happens to equal.
#
# Keywords are matched longest-first within a group so "semi formal" cannot be
# claimed by a shorter overlapping entry. Groups are tried in listed order.
#
# NOT here, deliberately: "headshot" (6 rows). Treasury left the Professional
# Development vs Membership call open, and a keyword rule cannot guess it.
# Likewise bare "ticket" -- it appears on formal, road trip and event payments
# alike, so on its own it names no committee.
MEMO_COMMITTEE_KEYWORDS: tuple[tuple[tuple[str, ...], int, str], ...] = (
    (("semi-formal", "semi formal", "semiformal", "formal"), 18, "formal"),

    # Added 2026-09-08 from the real Fall 2026 statement, where
    # "MEMBERSHIP REIMBURSEMENT SOCIAL" fell all the way through to the model
    # tier despite naming its committee in the memo.
    (("social",), 5, "social"),
    # "GBM" is General Body Meeting. The one occurrence in that statement --
    # "GBM #1 MEETING FOOD REIMBURSEMENT" -- was already resolved, but only
    # because "meeting food" happens to trip the food-merchant keyword. Naming
    # it makes the obvious case deterministic instead of incidental.
    (("gbm", "general body meeting"), 8, "GBM"),
)

# "membership" IS NOT IN THE TABLE ABOVE, and this is the important part.
#
# It is the obvious keyword to add after seeing "MEMBERSHIP REIMBURSEMENT
# SOCIAL" fall through, and adding it would be a serious bug. Checked against
# the real Fall 2026 statement: "membership" appears in **21 memos, 20 of them
# incoming dues payments** -- "MEMBERSHIP DUES", "AIS FALL 26 MEMBERSHIP",
# "MEMBERSHIP FEE". Everything in this table runs *ahead* of `rule_dues`, so a
# "membership" keyword would book roughly $1,000 of dues revenue into the
# Membership expense committee and strip the term attribution off every one of
# those rows.
#
# "social" is safe for exactly the reason "membership" is not: it appears once,
# on an outgoing transfer, and never in a dues memo. The test for a keyword
# belonging here is not "does it name a committee" but "can it collide with
# dues", and that has to be checked against real memos rather than assumed.

# Dues memos are handled separately by `rule_dues_memo`, NOT here, and the
# distinction is the whole design.
#
# Treasury asked for a dues memo keyword "in addition" to the amount rule. In
# addition is the operative word: it must not *replace* the schedule. So this
# group is not in the table above, because everything above runs ahead of
# `rule_dues` and would therefore shadow it. `rule_dues_memo` runs *after*
# instead, which means the schedule still gets first refusal and keeps its term
# attribution, and the memo only speaks for amounts the schedule turned down.
#
# The thing that made this safe to add: `quality.check_possible_dues_rate_change`
# reads raw amounts against the schedule, not `budget_category`, so booking
# these rows as dues does not hide a rate change from it. They are in fact the
# strongest possible evidence of one -- someone naming the payment themselves at
# an amount no term is known to have charged.
