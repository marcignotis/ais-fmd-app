-- ===========================================================================
-- Migration 006 -- "This isn't ours" flags. NOT YET RUN. Treasurer decision.
--
-- Adds the table behind the VP portal's "This isn't ours" button: a VP who thinks
-- a charge booked to their committee is wrong flags it with a note, and it lands
-- in the treasurer's Review Queue. A flag is a message, never an edit -- nothing
-- here changes `transactions`.
--
-- Written but not applied to any database. Run it against a throwaway Supabase
-- project first (see HANDOFF.md section 8.4), then the real one only when the
-- treasurer has decided VPs go live. Until it is run, the VP page and Review
-- Queue hide the feature instead of erroring (the backend reports the table
-- missing and the pages check before drawing).
--
-- Like migration 002, this does not enable row-level security: authorization
-- stays application-level (`auth.require`, plus the check inside
-- `create_flag` that a charge is booked to the caller's committee).
