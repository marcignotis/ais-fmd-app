"""
Module M4 -- merchant memory.

The highest-leverage cost reduction available, because most transactions are
repeat merchants. Once "PUBLIX #1234 GAINESVILLE FL" has been resolved once, it
never needs a model again.

A merchant key is the bank description with all the per-transaction noise
stripped out: the purchase date, card number, transaction ID, store number,
trailing city/state, and reference numbers. What remains is the stable part --
the merchant name.

Corrections made in the review queue write back here, so the set of rows that
still need a model shrinks every time the treasurer works the queue.

# How consistent a merchant's history must be before its mapping is applied
# without asking, and how many decisions that judgement needs to rest on.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Merchant memory used to store one committee per merchant and
# apply it at 0.95 confidence, short-circuiting everything else. That is right
# for a merchant which genuinely only ever means one thing -- a website host is
# always Technology, a print shop is always Merch -- and wrong for one that
# legitimately spans committees. A bar can be a Membership social, a Consulting
# client dinner, or a Professional Development event, and the flat mapping had
# no way to express that: whichever committee was confirmed last won every
# future transaction outright.
#
# The evidence for this is in the project's own measurements. `salty dog saloon`
# is settled as **Consulting** across 10 human decisions, while the hardcoded
# "bars are Membership" signal measured 38% precision and earned a fitted weight
# of exactly 0.00. A single stored answer cannot represent "7 Consulting, 3
# Membership" -- and that split is the useful thing to know.
#
# So a rule now carries the whole distribution. Consistent merchants
# short-circuit exactly as before; split ones contribute weighted evidence to
# scoring instead and let the surrounding context (card, memo, weekday, amount)
# break the tie, which is what routes them to a human rather than a coin-flip.
